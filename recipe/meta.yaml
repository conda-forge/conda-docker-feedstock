  summary: Create minimal docker images from conda environments
  description: |
    Conda Docker is an extension to the docker concept by having declarative
    environments that are associated with docker images. In addition this tool
    does not require docker to build images. Thus allowing for interesting
    caching behavior and tricks that docker would not normally allow.
